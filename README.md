This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Two env variables need to be set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and GitHub.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result - or wherever you choose to run it, as it points to `location.origin`.
